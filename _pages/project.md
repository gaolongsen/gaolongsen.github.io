    title: "Vision-Based Control for High-Speed Locomotion of a Bipedal Robot"
    excerpt: 'Achieving robust high-speed locomotion in bipedal robots presents significant challenges, particularly when traversing variable ground surfaces encountered in dynamic environments such as competitions. This research details a vision-based control framework designed to address this challenge. The system utilizes real-time computer vision to identify the characteristics of the upcoming terrain or mat surface. '
