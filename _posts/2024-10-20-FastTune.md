# **How do you get any placement position and rotation on MuJoCo quickly?**

When I build up a new MuJoCo environment or need to modify the environment based on the previous environment, especially I want to insert a new `body` or `geom` with a **precise position and rotation** , sometimes it's difficult because of the complexity of the high-DoF model and waste me lots of time:persevere:. Here you can use the tool I support here to help you find your desired placement in quick.

**Preparations**: Please refer the `mujoco-py` setup in my previous blog through this **[link](https://longsengao.com/blog/2024/MuJoCo/)** to install related dependencies.

**How to use:**

1. Add these code blocks on your own MuJoCo `xml` file:

   - Add below on   `<worldbody>`...`</worldbody>`:

   ```xml-dtd
       <body name="endeff_des" pos="0 0 0" mocap="true">
           <geom type="sphere" size="0.015" rgba="1 0 0 1" />
           <geom class="x_s_axis"/>
           <geom class="y_s_axis"/>
           <geom class="z_s_axis"/>
       </body>
   ```

   - Add below on your `</default>`...`</default>`:

   ```xml
       <default class="x_s_axis">
           <geom contype="0" conaffinity="0" group="1" rgba="1 0 0 1"
                 type="cylinder" size=".005 0.05" pos="0.05 0 0" euler="0 1.570796327 0"/>
       </default>
       <default class="y_s_axis">
           <geom contype="0" conaffinity="0" group="1" rgba="0 1 0 1"
                 type="cylinder" size=".005 0.05" pos="0 0.05 0" euler="1.570796327 0 0"/>
       </default>
       <default class="z_s_axis">
           <geom contype="0" conaffinity="0" group="1" rgba="0 0 1 1"
                 type="cylinder" size=".005 0.05" pos="0 0 0.05" euler="0 0 0"/>
       </default>
   ```

2. Drag the `Fast_Tune.py` file in any location on your PC (suggested to put it on the same location of your MuJoCo `xml` file.)

3. Change the two lines on the code  with your own MuJoCo environment file and referred frame:

   ```python
   ref_body_name = "satellite" # Change your refered frame
   xml_test_name = "/home/wam/sat_demo.xml"  # Change your own environment file location 
   ```

4. Then run the file. You will see the scenario like the following:

You can use  `←` `→` `↑` `↓` `F` `B`  on your keyboard to change the frame location; And `Q`/`W`, `A`/`S`, `Z`/`X` to change the row, pitch, yaw roation of the frame. You need to put the frame on your desired location and rotation. Then afterthat, record the data on the right-head dashboard as 

![](https://github.com/JackTony123/picx-images-hosting/raw/master/dash_data.3uuu12gwor.webp)



Note that when the frame is moving, the data on this area is also changing. `W-position` means the position of moving frame relative to the world frame in X, Y, Z; `B-position` means the position of moving frame relative to your specific frame in X, Y, Z;n Similar to  `W-Rotation` and `B-Rotation`. Based on this information, you can change your `xml` in a quick time.



Additionally, I also test in another project and find the effect is good.

If you can give me a star that this tool do help you for your project, I will be so happy. :two_hearts:
