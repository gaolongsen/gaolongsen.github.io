I'm now a third-year PhD student at AgMan Lab, University of New Mexico under the supervision of [Prof. Rafael Fierro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I7RhPnIAAAAJ&hl=en) and co-supervision of [Prof. Claus Danielson](https://www.unm.edu/~cdanielson/). Also, I'm now collaboratively working with [CMU Robotics Institute leading](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/about/) by [Prof. Howie Choset](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/) and TAMU LASER Lab leading by [Prof. Manoranjan Majji](https://lasr.tamu.edu/team/) in space autonomous robotics field.



My research interest focus on **high-DOF robotics manipulation**, **control system** and **machine learning**. Currently, I'm focusing on space servicing and repairing project leveraging multi-robot arm system and learning-based control algorithm. Besides, I'm passionate about vision-based grasping work and am now working on a vision-based pre-capturing project for free-flying space objects.

During my undergraduate study, before I became a PhD student, my life was almost entire of robotics, and most of the time, I stayed with different kinds of DIY robotics systems I designed and programmed. I participated in lots of national robotics competitions and won lots of national awards in various robotics competitions like bionic robotics, bipedal robotics, flying robotics, etc. When I started to get into robotics, I played with different kinds of 32-bit (STM32F1 series, STM32F4 series, NXP Kinetis) and 64-bit micro-controller(STM32H7 series, MSP430 series) using **C** and **Python** combined with different kinds of sensors(GPS, OpenMV, MPU, Infrared, smoking, force and torque sensor, etc) and actuators(servo motor, brush DC motor, brushless DC motor, etc). Also, I was, am and will be a **GEEK** ðŸ™‰ of fantastic and functional embedded systems and design lots of DIY embedded systems. More than five years of hands-on practice experience in both hardware and software made me deep into my truly loved field and get a complete understanding of robotics.
